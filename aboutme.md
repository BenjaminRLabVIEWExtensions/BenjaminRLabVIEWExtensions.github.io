I first discovered LabVIEW in 2004, during my studies in instrumentation engineering. Used from LabVIEW 7 to LabVIEW 8.6 to realize projects such as stand-alone instruments controls (over RS-232, RS-485, GPIB), VXI/VME applications, CAN bus monitoring, PXI based industrial control systems.

I started at NI in France by providing in-depth technical knowledge to support all NI products and helping customers to understand large application development practices and how to develop high-quality, reliable and/or safe applications using LabVIEW. I was given the chance to participate in localized version of LabVIEW (release 2009 and 2011) testing, verifying and validating. This led me to the R&D software developer at NI in the US where I designed, implemented and maintained LabVIEW based applications within the Academic Software team. At NI I have gained strong skills on the whole LabVIEW platform and also in LVOOP, VI Scripting and the LabVIEW IDE.

I had the opportunity to manage several software product releases for microfluidics instruments where I was in charge of the application architecture and engineering tools support.

In 2020, I was offered the great opportunity to join the Pazzi team to develop software frameworks and bespoke desktop and embedded software applications, always with Object-Oriented principles and paradigms in mind, for the world's first robotic pizza restaurant.  

Since 2021, I joined the Neosoft Technologies team in Montr√©al where I design and develop automated test systems based on LabVIEW, ensure the deployment of solutions on site and technically mentore developers for LabVIEW based applications, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
 
Huge FAN of LabVIEW, my goal is to continue to improve my skill and tool sets and bring my LabVIEW knowledge to the next level.
